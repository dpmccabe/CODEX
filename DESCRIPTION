Title: A Normalization and Copy Number Variation Detection Method for Whole
    Exome Sequencing
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Yuchao Jiang, Nancy R. Zhang

Description: A normalization and copy number variation calling procedure for
    whole exome DNA sequencing data. CODEXpar relies on the availability of 
    multiple samples processed using the same sequencing pipeline for 
    normalization, and does not require matched controls. The normalization 
    model in CODEXpar includes terms that specifically remove biases due to GC 
    content, exon length and targeting and amplification efficiency, and latent
    systemic artifacts. CODEXpar also includes a Poisson likelihood-based recursive
    segmentation procedure that explicitly models the count-based exome 
    sequencing data.
